abstract = {This book outlines the principles of thermoelectric generation and refrigeration from the discovery of the Seebeck and Peltier effects in the 19th century through the introduction of semiconductor thermoelements in the mid-20th century to the more recent development of nanostructured materials. The conditions for favourable electronic properties are discussed. The methods for selecting materials with a low lattice thermal conductivity are outlined and the ways in which the scattering of phonons can be enhanced are described. The book is aimed at readers without specialised knowledge.},
